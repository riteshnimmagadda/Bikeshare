# Bikeshare

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

For this analysis, I used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, i've created a set of visualizations to:

* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.



## Results:

* Checkout times for Users

As it is intutive fromt the above graphs that males are the high users for bikes in NYC area, it is also important to attract the females by offering more female bikes at the stations

it is also important to look at the age demographic for the rides to better serve the needs of the riders. 

Also, it might be worth it to try exploring electric bikes for elderly and tricycles for group riders.
