# Bikeshare

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

For this analysis, I used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, i've created a set of visualizations to:

* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.



## Results:

* Checkout times for Users
